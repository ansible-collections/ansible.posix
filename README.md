## Description

<!-- Describe the collection and why a user would want to use it. What does the collection do? -->
An Ansible Collection of modules and plugins that target POSIX UNIX/Linux and derivative Operating Systems.

## Requirements

* Python:
  * The Python interpreter version must meet Ansible Core's requirements.
* Ansible Core:
  - ansible-core 2.15 or later

## Installation

Before using this collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix
```

You can also include it in a requirements.yml file and install it with ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml, using the format:


```yaml
collections:
  - name: ansible.posix
```

Note that if you install any collections from Ansible Galaxy, they will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the Ansible package.
To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax to install version 2.0.0:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix:==2.0.0
```
