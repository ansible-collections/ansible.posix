bugfixes:
  - authorized_key - fix a bug where providing multiple key sources (URLs or file paths) separated by newlines would fail or only process the first source. The module now correctly resolves each source in a newline-separated list before processing the keys (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.posix/issues/684).
