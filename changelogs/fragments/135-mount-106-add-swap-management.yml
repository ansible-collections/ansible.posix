minor_changes:
  - mount - allow one to enable/disable swap spaces by mapping module's states
    (``mounted``, ``unmounted`` ...) to ``swapon`` and ``swapoff`` commands
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.posix/issues/106).
  - mount - refactor integration tests for better readability/understanding of
    what is tested and what OS is targeted.
